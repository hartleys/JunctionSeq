v1.1.3:
  * Very minor typographical fixes and clarifications in the vignette.

v1.1.1:
  * Release version. Minor cosmetic changes.

v0.99.8:
  * Very minor changes, mostly just fixing typos in the documentation and testing the functionality of the Bioconductor svn server.

v0.99.6:
  * JunctionSeq is now pre-approved by Bioconductor, and will probably be included in the next Bioconductor release.
  * Running in verbose mode, readJunctionSeqCounts now reports the number of gene aggregates found, and the total number of genes that belong to them.
  * Iterated version number to 0.99.6, to sync with bioconductor submission version numbering.

v0.6.46:
  * Minor update. Added references to the arxiv preprint manuscript. Fixed bad links in the vignette. Fixed a minor bug with the browser track creator.

v0.6.42:
  * Minor update. No real functional changes, but several changes to code style.
  * Removed all trailing semicolons
  * Used non-vectorized logical functions in conditional statements.
  * Removed old commented-out code.
  * Renamed the example dataset package to "JctSeqData", rather than "JctSeqExData2".

v0.6.30:
 * Very minor bugfix, fixing an issue when JunctionSeq is installed with the most recent pre-release version of the SummarizedExperiments bioconductor package (in the development version of R).
 * Also fixed some typos in the vignette.

v0.6.25:
 Major structural changes:
 * DESeq2 code is now called as foreign function calls and calls to exported DESeq2 functions. Copy-over of DESeq2 code greatly reduced.
 * As a consequence: JunctionSeq no longer requires Rcpp, RcppArmadillo.
 * JunctionSeq no longer requires compilation, it no longer includes any C++ code.

 In addition, a few minor bugfixes:
 * Fixed chromosome labels in gene profile plots.
 * Fixed behavior when label.p.vals is FALSE

v0.6.8:
 Several bugfixes, along with some error checking.
 * Fixed one place where I used an "T" instead of "TRUE", so BiocCheck stops complaining.
 * Local dispersion fit setting now propagates properly from runJunctionSeqAnalysis to fitJunctionSeqDispersionFunction.
 * Local dispersion fit now works with the standard "DESeq2-style" method.GLM.
 * Manual setting of inclusion thresholds now works with the "DESeq2-style" method.GLM.
 * keep.hypothesisTest.fit now prints a warning when attempted with the "DESeq2-style" method.GLM, as saving the fit statistics cannot easily be implemented using this method (since all the model fitting happens in C++).
 * If you attempt to plot a non-existent gene, it now prints an informative error.
 * Fixed other output-compatibility issues with the legacy "simpleML" mode.
 * Tested all sorts of combinations of method modes. Added warnings to at least some of the incompatible combinations.
 * Reduced extraneous messages in debug mode.
